# **Beseri Distributed Worker System**

A fault-tolerant, distributed job processing system designed for high-load background task execution.
It provides master → queue → worker architecture with retry logic, visibility timeouts, monitoring, and multi-language worker support (Python + C).

This project is built to demonstrate real distributed-systems engineering and production-grade architecture.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

* **Distributed Worker System**
  Multiple workers can run on different machines and process tasks concurrently.

* **Fault-Tolerant Reaper Engine**
  Recovers stuck jobs, requeues failed tasks, and handles crash situations safely.

* **Automatic Retries & Backoff**
  Configurable retry counts, exponential backoff, and job state tracking.

* **Visibility Timeout**
  Ensures tasks are returned to the queue if a worker dies mid-process.

* **C Worker Plugin Support**
  Fast, low-level worker implemented in C to demonstrate dual-language orchestration.

* **Docker & Compose Setup**
  Easy deployment with RabbitMQ + workers + master containers.

* **Job Queue Architecture**
  Clean separation between job producers and job consumers.

* **Extensible Job Handlers**
  Add new job types easily via Python modules.

## 📦 **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beserion/beseri_distributed_worker.git
cd beseri_distributed_worker
```

---

## 🐳 **Running with Docker (Recommended)**

This starts:

* RabbitMQ
* Master
* Worker
* Reaper

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Send a test job:

```bash
python3 master.py send-test
```

### Watch worker logs:

```bash
docker logs -f worker
```

---

## 🖥️ **Running Without Docker**

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start RabbitMQ:

```bash
sudo service rabbitmq-server start
```

### Run components:

```bash
python3 master.py
python3 worker.py
python3 reaper.py
```

## 📝 **Configuration**

Edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
retries: 5
backoff_seconds: 2
visibility_timeout: 30

queues:
  - image.process
  - analysis.batch
```

---

## 🧪 **Example: Creating a New Job Type**

Add a new file:

`jobs/video_encoder.py`:

```python
def run(payload):
    print("Encoding video:", payload["file"])
```

Then send job from master:

```python
python3 master.py send video.process file=movie.mp4
```
